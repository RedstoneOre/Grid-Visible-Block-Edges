# Grid-like Visible Block Edges
|![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/76bf5cac6fdc414da9cc5eaef42e2fcf1497585a.png)|See the edges of blocks clearly among many different blocks. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|

### Effect
1. Black and white lines will be rendered on the edge
2. The colors red, green, and blue appear at the corners of the faces of the cube on the X, Y, and Z axes(OF THE BLOCK,NOT THE WORLD), respectively.

### Usage
1. You can clearly know the offset direction of blocks such as flowers, bamboo, and grass.
2. You can clearly see the space occupied by the incomplete blocks.
3. You can simply get a general understanding of the situation of the blocks from a distance.

### Note
1. This package has modified many aspects of the block model, therefore it may be incompatible with some other resource packs about blocks. Please try to give this resource pack a higher priority first.
+ If other resource packs do not include 3D, intricate models, X-rays, etc., that affect block models, then the possibility of conflict is very low.
